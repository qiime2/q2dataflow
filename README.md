# q2dataflow - QIIME 2 Dataflow Interface
Automatic generator of dataflow descriptor languages.

The purpose of this interface is to enable the use of QIIME 2 plugins in
environments which support [Dockstore](https://dockstore.org) tools/workflows.

To see rendered tools, visit:

[qiime2/dockstore-tools](https://github.com/qiime2/dockstore-tools) (in progress)

## Roadmap
This project is currently under active development, and additional languages and features will be made available soon.

 - **Phase 1**: Finalize WDL implementation, implement .dockstore.yml manifest, automate per-plugin Docker builds, and publish WDL workflows to Dockstore.
 - **Phase 2**: Port [q2cwl](https://github.com/qiime2/q2cwl) to q2dataflow and publish CWL tools to Dockstore.
 - **Phase 3**: Add NextFlow (and potentially port Galaxy support from [q2galaxy](https://github.com/qiime2/q2galaxy)) and publish NextFlow tools to Dockstore.

### Currently supported:

  * [Workflow Description Language](https://openwdl.org/) (beta)

### Planned:
  * [Automatic .dockstore.yml registration](https://docs.dockstore.org/en/stable/getting-started/github-apps/github-apps.html#example-yml-files)
  * [Common Workflow Lanauage](https://www.commonwl.org/) (alpha: [q2cwl](https://github.com/qiime2/q2cwl), requires migration and updates)
  * [NextFlow](https://www.nextflow.io/) (TBD)


A similar interface exists for Galaxy Tool definitions called [q2galaxy](https://github.com/qiime2/q2galaxy),
which may be integrated into q2dataflow as well (although publication of these tools to Dockstore is not currently possible as only `.ga` files (not tools) are supported).

## Usage

```
q2dataflow q2wdl template {all | builtins} {output directory}
```

or

```
q2dataflow q2wdl template plugin {plugin_id} {output directory}
```

## Installation instructions

`q2dataflow` requires installation of the following packages:

* `qiime2`, including `qiime2.sdk` and the `q2-mystery-stew` plugin
* `click`
* `pytest`

Additionally, the WDL-related tests require:

1. an installation of the WDL emulator [`miniwdl`](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/miniwdl)
2. a docker environment containing an installation of`q2dataflow` and `qiime2`

If running on a Mac, it is very important for #1 to follow the Mac-specific
install instructions described in [https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/miniwdl/issues/145](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/miniwdl/issues/145);
`miniwdl` will fail in somewhat inscrutable ways if the `export TMPDIR=/tmp` step near the end is not performed.

For #2, a dockerfile is provided that will install `q2dataflow` and also the latest
`qiime2` distribution available on [quay.io/repository/qiime2/core](https://quay.io/repository/qiime2/core?tab=tags).
Note that when a new release becomes available, it is currently necessary to update the qiime2 environment name used in the
dockerfile (e.g., changing `RUN echo "conda activate qiime2-2022.8"` to `RUN echo "conda activate qiime2-2023.2"`)

Using this dockerfile, a docker image can be built from the command line in the top `q2dataflow` directory using the command

```docker build docker/ --build-arg CACHEBUST=$(date +%s) --tag testq2dataflow```

The name of the image, `testq2dataflow`, is important: it is used in generating
the test commands in `q2dataflow\languages\wdl\usage.py`.  Currently, it is set
in a variable in this module and should presumably be refactored to elsewhere.

The tests generate wdl files and parameter files and then run each wdl file (using
the parameters in the associated parameters file) through `miniwdl` on the `testq2dataflow`
docker image.  If the tests hang, go to a terminal, enter the conda environment
containing `miniwdl`, and run `miniwdl run_self_test`.  If *this* hangs due to
errors stating "error while loading TLS certificate in
/var/lib/docker/swarm/certificates/swarm-node.crt", then run
`docker swarm leave --force` and try again.
